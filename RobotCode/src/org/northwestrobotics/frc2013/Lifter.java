 * The actuator will be attached to the side of the side of the robot. There will be a flat disk screwed into the actuator.
 * The actuator will be facing down so when the button is pressed the disk will touch the ground and push the robot off the ground. 
 * There will be hooks on the top of the shooter. When the bot is pushed off the ground the hook will attach to the first level rung.
 * While the robot is hooked to the first rung the actuator will retract. Now the robot is not touching the ground and we will be awarded 10 points.
